  <p>Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne is an RPG released in Japan in 2003. It is
     an entry in the mainline Shin Megami Tensei series, a series of games
     taking place in a post-apocalyptic Tokyo. The player takes the role of a
     high school student who finds himself turned into a half-demon and thrown
     into an alternate world where demons and deities rule. The only humans left
     are two of his classmates, his teacher, a reporter, and a mysterious man
     who orchestrated the apocalypse.
  </p>

  <p>The game's narrative explores themes of helplessness, drive to power, and
    isolation in an increasingly technologically connected world. The remaining
    humans are given the opportunity by a mysterious cosmic will to reshape the
    world as they see fit and create their own personal utopia. Each character
    struggles with their own insecurities and ambitions in their journey to
    create the world they wish to see, recruiting like-minded demons in their
    ambition to re-create the world.</p>

  <p>Of course, the demons and deities in the narrative mirror the desires of
    the humans who created them. Some seek a world where might makes right and
    only the strong are fit to survive. Others envision a world where everyone
    is completely isolated from the pains associated with knowing other people.
    Some desire a world of complete silence where every living being in the
    universe can seek personal enlightenment away from any distractions.</p>

  <p>There is no clear answer as to which path is the correct one, if any. The
    player must choose for themselves what they think is right, be it accepting
    one of the three paths presented to them or rejecting all of them and
    fighting against the powers that put them in this position in the first
    place. While the player is free to choose from the paths presented to them,
    they are forbidden from forging their own path: despite having the ultimate
    authority on how the world is reshaped, they are powerless to create their
    own vision. Throughout the story, the player becomes isolated from the
    people that they once counted as friends. Even when the player is given a
    choice that seems meaningful, they are ultimately powerless.</p>

  <p>Everything in the game's narrative serves to explore the themes of
    powerlessness and isolation. The closer the end is, the further away the
    player drifts from the people they once knew. Whether or not the player
    chooses to reject or embrace their humanity, moving on means losing people
    they once loved. Oh, and the combat system is super fun. That's a topic for
    another essay, however.</p>
