      <p><strong>Note:</strong> This guide assumes that the reader has some
        familiarity with programming and data types. For an introduction on
        these topics,
        <a href='https://dev.to/aspittel/a-complete-beginner-s-guide-to-programming-2ni4'>
          A Complete Beginner's Guide to Programming</a> by Ali Spittel is an
          excellent place to start.</p>
      <p>Python is a high-level object-oriented scripting language, primarily
        used for server-side automation, and Python 3 is the latest major
        implementation. It has an emphasis on readability and follows explicit
        rules, particularly with whitespace characters. It was first released
        in 1990 and is still receiving regular updates.</p>
      <p>Python follows 19 guiding principles outlined in "The Zen of Python,"
        a manifesto written by Tim Peters in the public domain. It can even be
        accessed within the Python interpreter, as shown in the following
        terminal output:</p>
      <code>Python 3.6.0 (v3.6.0:41df79263a11, Dec 23 2016, 08:06:12) [MSC v.1900 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32

The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters
Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

      <p>This is, admittedly, a lot of information to digest when you're first
        getting started with learning the language. The biggest thing to take
        away as a beginner from these principles is the second line:
        "Readability counts." Python (mostly) forces programmers to write
        readable code, to the point where <strong>the interpreter does not
          ignore whitespace characters.</strong> More on this in the section on
          <a href='#Code_Blocks'>Code Blocks.</a></p>
    </section>

    <section class='main-section' id='Hello_World_(And_Variables)'>
      <header><h2>Hello World (And Variables)</h2></header>
      <p>The best way to understand how Python emphasizes readability is to
        look at some example programs, and Hello World is a good place to
        start:</p>
      <code>print('Hello, World!')</code>
      <p>That's it. Really! There's no need to import any libraries, no need to
        declare any functions, and no unintuitively named methods to call. You
        don't even need to add a semicolon at the end of each line! Above
        almost everything else, Python prioritizes code being readable.</p>
      <p>Declaring variables is similarly straightforward. The following program
        will output the first sentence of Mary Shelly's Frankensein, followed by
        the number 8:</p>
  <code>frankenstein = "I am by birth a Genevese, and my family is one of the most distinguished of that republic."
print(frankenstein)
myVar1 = 5
myVar2 = 3
print(myVar1 + myVar2)</code>
      <p>An important thing to note about Python is that unlike JavaScript, it
        does not coerce variables into the same type when presented with two
        different types of variables. For example, if we were to type
        <span class='code-snippet'>print(3 + "5")</span> into our Python
        interpreter, we would get an error.</p>
    </section>

    <section class='main-section' id='F-Strings'>
      <header><h2>F-Strings</h2></header>
      <p>One of the distinguishing features of Python 3 is how it handles
        formatting variables into strings. Python 3 uses a data type called
        "f-strings" when inserting variables into strings. F-strings have
        special syntax compared with normal strings. As an example, the
        following outputs this page's author's name and age:</p>
      <code>>>> name = "Diane"
>>> age = 30
>>> print(f"{name} is {age} years old and says hello!")
Diane is 30 years old and says hello!</code>
      <p>The syntax for f-strings is a lower or uppercase 'f' followed by single
        or double quotes, with variable names surrounded by {curly brackets}.
        F-strings can be used anywhere regular strings can be used, and can even
        be used inside variable declarations.</p>
      <p>Python 3 still supports the older method of formatting strings by using
        <span class='code-snippet'>str.format()</span> but this method is much
        less readable to anyone viewing program code. The following example has
        the same output as the previous one, but uses the older method of
        <span class='code-snippet'>str.format()</span>:</p>
      <code>>>> name = "Diane"
>>> age = 30
>>> print("{} is {} years old and says hello!".format(name, age))
Diane is 30 years old and says hello!</code>
      <p>Formatting strings by using <span class='code-snippet'>str.format()
      </span> is less common in Python 3 programs, but it is still important to
      recognize it, as it often appears in legacy code.</p>
    </section>

    <section class='main-section' id='Code_Blocks'>
      <header><h2>Code Blocks</h2></header>
      <p>One of the unique (and controversial) things about Python is how it
        handles code blocks and whitespace characters. The syntax for code
        blocks is influenced by a few of the guiding principles outlined
        earlier. In particular:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Beautiful is better than ugly.</li>
    <li>Explicit is better than implict.</li>
    <li>Sparse is better than dense.</li>
    <li>Readability counts.</li>
  </ul>
      <p>The syntax for code blocks follows three rules:</p>
      <ol>
    <li>The line of code that starts a block ends with a colon. (e.g.
      <span class='code-snippet'>if age == 30:</span>)</li>
        <li>Each line of code in a block is preceded by <strong>exactly</strong>
          four (4) whitespace characters.</li>
    <li>The last line of code with 4 preceding whitespace characters is the last
      line of the block.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Blocks of code can be nested within each other, but it's considered
        best practice to avoid this when possible. The following is an example
        of Python's syntax for code blocks, including a nested block of code.</p>
  <code>print("Let's see what numbers up to 20 are divisible by 5.")
i = 0

while i <= 20:
    if i % 5 == 0:
        print(f"{i} is divisible by 5.")
    else:
        print(f"{i} is not divisible by 5.")

    print("Let's move on to the next number.")
    i += 1

print("Those are all the positive numbers up to 20 that are divisble by 5.")</code>
  <p>Although whitespace characters are explicit in Python, extra return
    carriages are not. Code within a block can have extra return carriages and
    will still execute properly, as long as the correct number of whitespace
    characters are used.</p>
    </section>

    <section class='main-section' id='Functions'>
      <header><h2>Functions</h2></header>
      <p>The syntax for declaring and calling functions is straightforward and
        consistent in Python. A function will always be declared by a
        <span class='code-snippet'>def</span> statement, followed by the
        function's name, followed by any arguments it will take (contained
        within parentheses), and ending with a colon
        (<span class='code-snippet'>:</span>). Functions do not need to have a
        <span class='code-snippet'>return</span> statement in order to end and
        will end whenever their code block does. Functions <strong>must</strong>
        be declared before they are called. An example program with a function
        that greets the user follows:
<code>def sayHello(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}.")
    print("It's a pleasure to meet you!")

print("Please enter your name.")
sayHello(input("> "))</code>
      <p>When the author of this page runs the program, her terminal output
        looks like this:</p>
      <code>Please enter your name.
> Diane
Hello, Diane.
It's a pleasure to meet you!</code>
    </section>
      <p>There is no set upper or lower limit to the number of arguments a
        function can accept in Python, but for the sake of readability, it's
        generally considered best practice to limit the maximum number of
        arguments to three. Functions can be called within other functions as
        long as they're defined before they're called.</p>
    <section class='main-section' id='Additional_Resources'>
      <header><h2>Additional Resources</h2></header>

        of resources that go into much more detail than this page does. To get
